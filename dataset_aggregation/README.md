# Dataset aggregation

The files here are used to aggregate the data in MSD style datasets from the following datasets:
- basel-mp2rage
- bavaria-quebec-spine-ms-unstitched
- canproco
- nih-ms-mp2rage
- sct-testing-large

The files in this repo are: 
- `create_msd_data.py`: creates the basic MSD dataset with the above listed datasets
- `create_msd_data_head_cropped.py` : creates the MSD dataset similarly to the code above, but also crops the head.
